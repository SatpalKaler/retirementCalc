How It Works

The calculator uses the compound interest formula to estimate the growth of your savings and investments over time, factoring in monthly contributions and annual returns. It also adjusts for inflation to provide a realistic view of your purchasing power at retirement.

Formulas Used

	1.	Future Value (FV):

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) + PMT * ((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n)

	•	P: Present Value
	•	r: Annual Interest Rate
	•	n: Compounding Frequency per Year
	•	t: Time in Years
	•	PMT: Monthly Payment

	2.	Inflation-Adjusted Value:

FV_adjusted = FV / (1 + inflation_rate)^t



Assumptions

	•	EPF annual return: 5%
	•	Investment annual return: 7%
	•	Inflation rate: 3%
	•	Compounding frequency: Monthly
